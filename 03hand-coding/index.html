        <h1> Pasta Process</h1>
        <p>Pasta products are produced by <strong> milled wheat, water, eggs</strong> (for egg noodles or egg
        spaghetti), and sometimes optional ingredients. These ingredients are typically added to a continuous,
        high capacity auger extruder, which can be equipped with a variety of dies that determine the shape of
        the pasta. The pasta is then dried and packaged for market.</p>
        <p>This is an interesting but not surprising fact since pasta is often <em>associated with Italy</em>. Nevertheless,
        one would expect a country with a larger population, such as the United States or China, to consume the most
        pasta worldwide. However, The International Pasta Organization stated that if <a href="Pasta.html">every Italian ate all pasta</a>in
        spaghetti form, they would consume about 600 million kilometers of spaghetti. The noodles required to make
        that much spaghetti would wrap around the earth 15,000 times</p>
       
        <h2>Thing's To Know About Pasta</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Most people believe pasta is the most important component
                 of Italian cuisine, but the meal did not originate in Italy. Instead, pasta is an ancient Chinese meal that later became popular
                 in Italy thanks to the travels of Marco Polo. The Italian traveler went to China in around 1271 and came back with details about pasta. However, 
                 some claim that the Etruscans and Romans already knew about pasta long before Marco Polo helped rediscover the meal.</li>

        <h2>Who Made Pasts?</h2>
            <p>Marco Polo introduced pasta to Italy following his exploration of the Far 
            East in the late 13th century,pasta can be traced
            back as far as the 4th century B.C., where an Etruscan tomb 
            showed a group of natives making what appears to be pasta.</p>
